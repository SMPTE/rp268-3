Please consult [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md), [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md) and [PATENTS.md](./PATENTS.md) for important notices.

## Scope

This Recommended Practice specifies test images and a procedure to check correct operation of ST 268-2 DPX reader implementations.

The software elements for this document are located in the following repository: https://github.com/SMPTE/rp268-3-a

## Background

The Digital Picture eXchange (DPX) file format is defined in SMPTE ST 268-1, and DPX format extensions for high dynamic range and wide color gamut pictures are defined in SMPTE ST 268-2. RP 268-3 will provide reference materials for testing reader and writer implementations that conform to the extensions in SMPTE ST 268-2. Reference code, test images, and a draft document containing a procedure to check SMPTE ST 268-2 DPX reader operation are available on GitHub for public review and comment. The feedback period will close no earlier than May 15th, 2022, and no later than February 15th, 2023.
